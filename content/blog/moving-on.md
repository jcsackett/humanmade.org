<div><p>I had just started college when 9/11 happened. I had, for all intents and purposes, just started thinking of myself as an adult.</p>
<p>I remember that day very well. I woke up and it seemed like the world had ended. Remembering that my father had business in/near the Pentagon, I joined the hundreds trying to reach family and make sure they were okay.</p>
<p>The day ended, but our problems surely didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>These days, it seems like I&#8217;ve basically spent my adult life living in 9/11. It&#8217;s everywhere. It&#8217;s image is called up all the time, for reasons personal, political, religious, and other. I understand this. 9/11 was a tragedy. It was a horrible event, a horrible day, and began a horrible span of time.</p>
<p>But I am <i>tired</i> of living in 9/11. It has been almost a decade, and we are still caught up in it. We are still talking about a post-9/11 world, but our post-9/11 world seems awfully bound to an eternal replay of those days. It&#8217;s time for us, as a nation, to <i>move on</i>.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is 9/12. I would really like to try living there for a while. Wouldn&#8217;t you?</p></div>
