<div><p>An interesting point in time: we are now talking as a species about the serious viability of traveling space by <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/10/science/space/10solar.html">travelling on solar winds</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the stuff of bad space operas&#8212;sailing through the stars on huge mylar sheets. And yet, with the successful flight of LightSail-1, it can become reality.</p>
