<blockquote>
<p><em>Nice to meet you,</em>
<em>How are you and how is your work? i hope that all is well with you, My name is miss Happiness ,i know that you may be suprise how i get your email, i got your email today when i was browsing looking for honest partner,then i feel to drop this few line to you , and  i will like you to contact me through my email so that we can know each other and exchange our pictures, and we maybecome partner.</em></p>
<p><em>Remember the distance does not matter what matters is the love we share with each other.</em></p>
<p><em>i am waiting  to hear from you soon.</em></p>
<p><em>kiss regards Miss Happiness</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;m not really sure what the scam here is. I mean, it reads like something sent by a Nigerian scammer. Maybe this is what happens to lonely Nigerian housewives?</p></div>
