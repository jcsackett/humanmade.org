<div><p><a href="http://onefuckingparagraph.tumblr.com" title="1F¶">A new proposal</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still intent on doing more writing here, but my &#8220;one big ass meaningful post&#8221; thing isn&#8217;t working. Clearly.</p>
<p>So scratch that. I&#8217;ve got another blog up <strike>(which I&#8217;ll sync to here as well (thanks tumblr imports))</strike> (which will <em>not</em> be imported here because you can&#8217;t do that with tumblr feeds). The premise is simple. One paragraph a day. Just one.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see how <em>that</em> goes.</p></div>
