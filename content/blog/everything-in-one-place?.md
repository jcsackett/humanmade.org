title: Everything in One Place?
---

<div><p>So I can now pull my <a href="http://1fp.humanmade.org" title="One Fucking Paragraph">1FP</a> feed into this blog, because I&#8217;ve added all of my blog feeds to feedburner.</p>
<p>The question is, should I? I&#8217;ve already seen that two people who follow me here (via tumblr, not rss) are following me on 1fp as well. I would hate to saturate lots of people with repeats.</p>
<p>Comments have been put back into place in this (look for the word comment over on the left by the icon). Let me know what you think.</p></div>
