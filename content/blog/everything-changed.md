title: Everything Changes
---

Hey, the new site setup [referenced before][0] is live! Sadly, this does mean
you need to update your bookmarks and/or feeds.

## humanmade.org

The main page of humanmade is much as it always was. New colors, but that's
about it. It's all running on nanoc now, which is pretty nice. The blog is
accessible from [humanmade.org/blog/][1] and [blog.humanmade.org][2]. At some
point the latter will become a redirect to the former, but for now we'll leave
it as is.

The feed is [humanmade.org/blog.xml][3].

## tumblr

I still love tumblr, and I'm not leaving it. The tumblr lives on at
[tumblr.humanmade.org][4]. Random links, videos, images, and so on will
continue to be posted there. Additionally, anything posted here will be
crossposted to tumblr via [IFTTT][5]. So if you just want to follow tumblr
stuff, that's fine.

The feed there is [tumblr.humanmade.org/rss][6].

## Why the change?

Obviously, given everything is still feeding in to tumblr, I have no problem
with it. But increasingly, I do feel the need to own my stuff. Which is to
say, if you're reading this on my site, *all of this is mine*. The content all
lives on my computer, and in my git repos, and on my server. I don't have to
export it weirdly using a tool that only works on OS X. I don't have to munge
that data to get it back into nice plain markdown. I own this, and I make it
do what I want it to do.

## 1fp?

1fp still lives at [1fp.humanmade.org][7]. I think I will probably resume it soon,
in some form.
