title: Manic Pixie Dream Boy?
---

<div><p>So last night in a conversation that was sort of all over the place, I ended up explaining the concept of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_Pixie_Dream_Girl">Manic Pixie Dream Girl</a> to a friend<sup id="fnref:p13871435934-1"><a href="#fn:p13871435934-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Intrigued, he apparently googled it at home, and found out that it&#8217;s been subverted&#8212;or at least lampshaded&#8212;in a few movies.</p>
<p>Which made me wonder. Hollywood loves being &#8220;creative&#8221; by doing the obvious inversion of a trope. So is there a movie with a Manic Pixie Dream Boy? And if not, why not?</p>

<p>The Zooey Deschanel show was on. It was contextually relevant, if only just. <a href="#fnref:p13871435934-1" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
