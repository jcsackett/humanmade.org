<div><p>I attended BarCamp this past Saturday, taking advantage of one of the few free moments this month that I had. Quite a lot of interesting stuff going on.</p>
<p><a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/375578/BarCampRDU/index.html">My notes</a>, such as they are, are available here. I&#8217;m not sure how useful they are to someone who wasn&#8217;t there, but feel free to take a look.</p></div>
