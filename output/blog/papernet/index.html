<div><p>The entirety of this is listed from an email on Bad Signal by <a href="http://warrenellis.com" title="Warren Eliss's blog">Warren Ellis</a>. I&#8217;m posting it here because I can&#8217;t find a version of it on his blog and I don&#8217;t trust gmail as an easy archive of everything anymore.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The &#8220;papernet&#8221; &#8212; and I suspect the borders of the
  definition are already becoming fuzzy &#8212; begins from
  the stance that paper is still really useful and a nice
  thing to have. Written language is the original cultural
  virus, because you can pass that fucker around.</p>
<p>You can read this, for some background:</p>

<p>The Papernet Stance says that sometimes you
  want the internet to spit out a bit of paper. Not
  least because it remains a pain in the arse for
  every given location to spit out a file to every
  mobile device &#8212; and, even more importantly, because
  not everyone has a mobile device.</p>
<p>Why does this even matter? Well, I don&#8217;t know about
  you, but I&#8217;m in the business of moving ideas around.
  So if someone I know fired out a PDF of a single
  page that was a broadside, a folded four-page 
  pamphlet or even, per Elizabeth Genco, an 8pp
  minizine</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/elizabethgenco/sets/72157594276405114/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/elizabethgenco/sets/72157594276405114/</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;d be interested in that. There can be powerful
  reasons why something needs to be experienced
  in pages, and there can be useful reasons why I&#8217;d
  want to leave the house with a printed folded sheet
  of paper in my pocket.</p>
<p>And there will always be people who donate time and
  toner to running off those things, in locations far
  distant from the creator, and giving them away.</p>
<p>Of course, one day, we&#8217;ll be able to print them off at
  home on indestructible Tyvek, so the only evidence of
  human life on this planet in a million years&#8217; time will
  be your minicomic of a hobbit cornholing someone
  from Battlestar Galactica.</p>
