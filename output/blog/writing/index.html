<div><p>I am shit at writing.</p>
<p>Complete shit.</p>
<p>In school I was led to believe that I could write, but I couldn&#8217;t. What I could do was string vocabulary words together while following a formula dictated by that year&#8217;s teacher. I put lots of words on lots of paper, but I never said much. Certainly never anything I cared about.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not writing.</p>
<p>Writing is facing down a blank page and beating an idea into a shape worth sharing. I can&#8217;t do that consistently, and I can&#8217;t do it well. What I have been doing is letting the teeniest snippets of text get out while I throw out most with the rationalization that I&#8217;m &#8220;editing&#8221; when all I&#8217;m doing is not finishing anything.</p>
<p>This is a problem for me, because I&#8217;ve always identified as a &#8216;writer&#8217;, and yet I don&#8217;t write. This blog, ostensibly a platform for writing, has become about link sharing with no real ideas of my own. <a href="http://thepatches.tumblr.com">Patches</a>, who has claimed to me that he isn&#8217;t a writer, has done more writing than I have in years.</p>
<p>On my computer there is a folder named &#8220;Writing.&#8221; It has a dozen half started pieces in it. I haven&#8217;t touched half of them since 2005. I have not touched any of the others since 2009, save one 10 page work that took me 2 years of half-assing to get to a point I declared &#8220;finished.&#8221;</p>
<p>Enough is enough.</p>
<p>November is a month when a lot of people begin writing projects as part of NaNoWriMo. I have no notion of engaging fully in that pursuit&#8212;my writing muscles are too clumsy, and my time is too dear.  But I am using this month as a starting point in getting those muscles into shape, and seeing what time can be found for it. My intention is to write something of decent length for a small column each week. I have no idea what. Most of it, I&#8217;m certain, will be crap. But the only way to get better at this is to do it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m shit at writing.</p>
<p>But I can get better.</p></div>
