<div><p>Back in August Charlie Stross wrote a <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2009/08/merciless.html">pretty biting article</a> nominally about the release of Abdelbaset Al Megrahi but ultimately about his perceptions of the American body politic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a cancer in the collective American soul — a mercy deficit that has in recent years grown as alarmingly as the budget deficit. Nor is it as simple as a left/right thing: no political party has a monopoly on merciless behaviour. Rather, a creeping draconian absolutism has cast its penumbra across the entire arena of public discourse, tainting every debate, poisoning and hardening attitudes across the board.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He&#8217;s certainly entitled to his opinion, and I can see where he&#8217;s coming from, but he went too general in his post. The United States has a population of 300,000,000. That&#8217;s a whole lot of people to draw conclusions about based on reporting that regrettably focuses on vocal minorities as often as not.</p>
<p>Pointing a finger across the ocean to vent about a place with remarkably different social norms isn&#8217;t productive. The United States surely has problems, and Stross is right in noting that a portion of our population seems to be ever more hardline; to move from that to &#8220;a cancer in the collective American soul&#8221; is entirely too strong, and is in itself lacking in the lower form of mercy&#8212;benefit of the doubt.</p></div>
